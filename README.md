# fallback-supernova
## Fallback supernova of an exploding star with a (compact object) companion

## Documentation
These scripts have been developed to study supernova interaction and fallback in double compact object formation, mostly in the context of gravitational-wave sources.
This repo includes scripts to:
- Create initial conditions for 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code,
- Run 3D SPH simulations in computer clusters,
- Analyze the output of the 3D SPH simulations, and
- Reproduce plots from papers using these results.

More details of the structure of the repo and its contents will be added soon.
